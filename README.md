# MData - Docker image

## Pre-requisites

Docker app for your respective platform

- [Docker][https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/installation/]

For Macs and Unix OS, ensure that the run_mdata.sh has execute permissions

```
$ chmod 744 run_mdata.sh
```

For Windows:

```
<to be defined>
```

## Start MData

To start mdata use the following command:

```
sh run_mdata.sh up
```

If you want to run all the mdata services as a daemon, run below instead:

```
sh run_mdata.sh up -d
```

__Note__: If this the first time, docker will download, Node, Neo4J and Redis images and it might take some time before the entire thing starts up. Subsequent times will be a lot quicker.

You should see in the logs on your console something like below:

```
Starting cache                ... done
Starting mdata-docker_neo4j_1 ... done
Starting mdata-docker_mdata-worker_1 ... done
Starting mdata-docker_mdata-web_1    ... done

```

#### Ensuring all the 4 services for Mdata are up and running

TO confirm all of the 4 services are running, execute the below:

```
docker ps
```

This should display something like below. The `CONTAINER ID` will be different.

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                        NAMES

```

### Shutting down mData

If you didn't run mdata as a daemon, you can simply kill the process `Ctrl + C` will do the trick in most OS platforms.

IF you started it as a daemon, execute below to shut down:

```
sh run_mdata.sh down
```

## Accessing MData and kicking of an org indexing

Once you have successfully started the docker services, just point your browser to (http://localhost:3000/) and that should give you the main page to login to production or sandbox and the rest should be automated.


## Accessing Neo4j Browser

Go to http://localhost:7474/browser

For the connection and username/password enter the below:

- `Connection URL`: http://localhost:7474
- `Username` : neo4j
- `Password` : test
